# Version 1.0

## This file describes the syntax and the possible options that can be specified in the configuration file (which represents an experiment). ##

# Lines starting with # are comments. #

# Usage of the program: ./main -c experiment_file
# The file example represents a minimal working example: ./main -c example 
# This (CONFIG) file can also be passed as argument to the program: ./main -c CONFIG

[General]

# The number of threads used in the computation
threads=4

# The order of the attack.
# 1: first-order (default)
# 2: second-order, if window=1 corresponds to second order moment
# n (>2): n-th order standardized moments 
order=1

# The return type of the correlation.
return_type=double

# The size of the window when computing 2-order CPA
# Warning, window starts indexing at the position of the first index.
# e.g. i=23, window=4 => 23, 24, 25, 26
window=3

# The algorithm to attack can be
# AES
# DES
algorithm=AES

# The position to attack, must be specified as a path to the file containing 
# the corresponding lookup table. Warning, there is a specific trigger for DES
position=LUT/AES_AFTER_SBOX

# The switch specific to DES, specifying the layout of the lookup table
# WARNING: If attacking multiple SBOXES, the layout must be the same 
# among them
# Can be either of
# DES_8_64 : 8 arrays of 64 values
# DES_8_64_ROUND : same as DES_8_64 but target is round output, after
#	recombination of SBOX output and half left state
# DES_32_16 : 32 arrays of 16 values, where the offset is selected with 
#	the first and last bits of the internal 6-bit values, and the
#	lookup is done on the 4 middle bits
# DES_4_BITS : Ignores lookup table and just compute the correlation 
#	before the SBOX on the 4 middle bits. However, one must still 
#	specify a file in order for it to work
# DES_6_BITS : Ignores lookup table and just compute the correlation 
#	before the SBOX on the 6 bits. However, one must still 
#	specify a file in order for it to work
#des_switch=DES_8_64

# The round to attack. Only the first (round=0) is supported for the moment.
round=0

# The number of the key byte to attack. Can be either an integer or "all"
bytenum=all
#bytenum=0

# The bit number in the byte to attack. 
# Options: none, all, <int>
# Where int is 0, ..., 7 for AES and 0, ..., 3 for DES
# Default (if unspecified) is none
bitnum=all

# The correct key if we know it. If unspecified, the program outputs
# the highest correlation for all keys. If speficied, only outputs the
# rank of the known key. This behavious is similar to inspector.
# Might also be used later for known key attacks. 
# Can be specified:
#   as a single key byte (in decimal or in hexadecimal with 0x prefix),
#   as the whole key in hex (0x8f f9 8b 4a 7a a3 5b 69 30 1c b2 a7 91 07 6b 7e)
# WARNING: Specifying a single key byte does not work with DES, as we need
#	the complete key to generate the round keys.
#correct_key=100
#correct_key=0x8f f9 8b 4a 7a a3 5b 69 30 1c b2 a7 91 07 6b 7e

# The memory available. Used with attack=50 only. Possible suffixes:
# G: Giga
# M: Mega
memory=4G

# The number of global correlation we keep track of.
top=20

# The separator for printing, if not specified, normal prints with many details
# if something is specified, prints in the following format:
# byte_number "sep" key_byte "sep" time "sep" key "sep" correlation
# But this only works when the correct key specified
